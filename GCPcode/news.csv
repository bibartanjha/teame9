5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27115d,2020-09-23T01:07:54,Chicago Bulls Hire Billy Donovan As Head Coach,The Chicago Bulls have reportedly agreed to a deal that will make Billy Donovan the new head coach of the organization. Donovan is an experienced coach that did an excellent job of developing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander this season. It'll be interesting to see what Donovan is able to do with the Bulls young core. He was able to accomplish quite a lot during his time in Oklahoma City. Hopefully the Bulls have finally found a coach that can get the most out of their young core.,Transactions,CHI,Adrian Wojnarowski,https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1308526104718737415
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271164,2020-09-09T18:16:32,Robert Covington Should Play In Game 4,Houston Rockets forward Robert  Covington (face) is expected to be available for Game 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers. It doesn't sound like his nose is broken and Covington was able to pass the concussion protocol. Danuel  House (personal) is questionable for Game 4; which could mean big minutes for Covington. Fantasy owners should check back for another update.,Injuries,HOU,Tim MacMahon,https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1303684145059635201
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271173,2020-08-23T13:57:51,Steven Adams Exits Late In Fourth Quarter,Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven  Adams (knee) suffered an injury late in the fourth quarter of Saturday's Game 3 win over the Houston Rockets and did not return. He is reportedly dealing with a right knee contusion. Nerlens  Noel could be asked to play heavy minutes if Adams is unable to suit up for Game 4. It's unclear how significant of an injury it is at the moment. Fantasy owners should get another update before tip-off on Monday.,Injuries,OKC,Royce Young,https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1297336840547172352
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27115f,2020-09-21T18:23:44,Will Barton Likely Out For Western Conference Finals,Denver Nuggets guard/forward Will  Barton (knee) is not expected to return to the team at any point of the Western Conference Finals against the Lakers; according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. The 29-year-old has not appeared in a game since the NBA restart in Orlando as he continues to rehabilitate from a knee injury that he suffered earlier in the season. With the Nuggets two games away from elimination in the Western Conference Finals; Barton's next game action will likely be delayed to the start of the 2020-21 season after averaging 15.1 points; 6.3 rebounds; 3.7 assists and 1.1 steals on 45% shooting from field goal range through 58 games during the 2019-20 season.,Injuries,DEN,The Athletic,https://theathletic.com/2078184/2020/09/21/inside-pass-clippers-concerns-plus-more-notes-from-around-the-nba/
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271159,2020-10-04T00:01:11,Goran Dragic Unlikely To Play In Game 3,Miami Heat guard Goran  Dragic (foot) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's Game 3 against the Los Angeles Lakers. He suffered a left plantar fascia tear and the Heat are not optimistic that Dragic will be able to suit up. Tyler  Herro should remain in the starting five; while Kendrick  Nunn will see more minutes coming his way. Both players could be interesting DFS options without Dragic on the court.,Injuries,MIA,Shams Charania,https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1312501098670821376?s=20
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27116b,2020-09-02T21:18:29,Eric Bledsoe Could Miss Game 2,Milwaukee Bucks guard Eric  Bledsoe (hamstring) is listed as a game-time decision for Wednesday's Game 2 versus the Miami Heat. Bledsoe was limited during Tuesday's practice; but head coach Mike Budenholzer was hopeful that Bledsoe will be ready for this matchup. It's likely going to depend on how Bledsoe feels during pregame warmups. George  Hill would likely be asked to make another start if Bledsoe is unable to play. Hill would see increased playing time; but didn't do much damage during his last start.,Injuries,MIL,Matt Velazquez,https://twitter.com/Matt_Velazquez/status/1301261024230879232
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271171,2020-08-25T20:01:19,Russell Westbrook Not Quite Ready Yet,Houston Rockets guard Russell  Westbrook (quad) has been sidelined all series; but remains day-to-day; according to head coach Mike D'Antoni. He is dealing with a strained right quad and it's unclear if he'll suit up for Wednesday's Game 5 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. There should be more information known on Wednesday; so fantasy owners will have to check back then. In the meantime; James  Harden will be a must-have fantasy option; while Eric  Gordon and Danuel  House continue to see increased value.,Injuries,HOU,Jonathan Feigen,https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Feigen/status/1298328544267907073
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27115c,2020-09-29T15:43:12,Doc Rivers Fired As Clippers Head Coach,Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers has been fired by the organization. This comes as quite a surprise after there were multiple reports that his job was safe. However; the organization has decided to move on after their playoff loss. It's unclear who the Clippers plan to bring in. Rivers does deserve some of the blame for their playoff exit; but it wasn't all on him. Paul George struggled heavily; so that was a huge factor as well. Whoever the Clippers decide to bring in is going to have a lot of pressure to win after the team gave up seven first-rounders and guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for George.,Transactions,LAC,Adrian Wojnarowski,https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1310689859191951360?s=20
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27115e,2020-09-22T21:16:35,Romeo Langford Out For Rest Of Postseason,Boston Celtics guard Romeo  Langford (wrist) is scheduled to undergo surgery on Tuesday and will miss the rest of the postseason. He'll undergo surgery to repair the scapholunate ligament in his right wrist. The Celtics have not given a timetable for the young guards return yet. However; the season isn't expected to start until around December; so Langford should have plenty of time to recover. His absence won't mean much for the Celtics rotation. Hopefully he'll be able to contribute to the team next season.,Injuries,BOS,Boston Celtics,https://twitter.com/celtics/status/1308477851168055296
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271161,2020-09-16T20:22:33,Davis Bertans Skips Bubble To Preserve His Health,Washington Wizards forward Davis  Bertans decided to sit out the Orlando bubble in order to preserve his health for free agency. Bertans is an upcoming free agent and the Wizards had a slim chance of making the playoffs. He didn't believe it was worth the risk after not playing basketball for almost two months. Bertans sitting out shouldn't hinder his value whatsoever on the free agent market. He'll be a highly coveted player; but the Wizards are likely going to be aggressive to keep him in Washington.,Transactions,WAS,NBC Sports,https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/davis-bertans-explains-why-he-didnt-play-orlando-and-his-beef-evan-fournier
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271166,2020-09-07T19:11:25,Giannis Antetokounmpo Should Play In Game 5,Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis  Antetokounmpo (ankle) is expected to suit up for Tuesday's Game 5 against the Miami Heat. He was only able to play 11 minutes during Sunday's contest before exiting with a sprained right ankle. Antetokounmpo was wearing a protective boot after Sunday's contest; so it doesn't sound like he'll be 100 percent healthy by Tuesday. Khris  Middleton would see his usage skyrocket if Antetokounmpo is unable to play. Donte  Divincenzo could be a sneaky DFS option with extended minutes.,Injuries,MIL,Kane Pitman,https://twitter.com/KanePitman/status/1303017714437427200
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27116c,2020-09-01T19:15:04,Eric Bledsoe Limited During Tuesday's Practice,Milwaukee Bucks guard Eric  Bledsoe (hamstring) was a limited participant during Tuesday's practice. He was unable to play during Game 1 versus the Miami Heat on Monday due to a right hamstring strain. George  Hill drew the start; but didn't do much damage during his 36 minutes of play. The fact Bledsoe was limited on Tuesday means he'll likely sit out of Wednesday's Game 2 matchup. That would mean another start for Hill; but he's not the most appealing DFS option.,Injuries,MIL,Ira Winderman,https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1300870638387826689
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271174,2020-08-22T17:25:51,Luka Doncic Could Miss Game 4,Dallas Mavericks guard Luka  Doncic (ankle) is in danger of missing Game 4 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday; according to head coach Rick Carlisle. Doncic suffered a left ankle injury during Friday's game; but said afterwards that the injury wasn't too bad. He is currently listed as questionable and will undergo an MRI on Saturday. There is a decent chance that he sits out at least one game; but we'll wait and see. Seth  Curry; Trey  Burke; and Delon  Wright would be asked to step up if Doncic is unable to play. Curry would become a popular DFS option without Doncic on the court. Kristaps  Porzingis would see his usage and fantasy value skyrocket as well.,Injuries,DAL,Tim MacMahon,https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1297180485362352128
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271172,2020-08-24T16:18:59,George Hill Probable For Game 4,Milwaukee Bucks guard George  Hill (hamstring) is listed as probable for Game 4 versus the Orlando Magic on Monday. He is dealing with some left hamstring soreness; but is expected to suit up. It doesn't sound like Hill is going to be limited at all; but he'll remain a risky DFS option anyway. The Bucks are fairly healthy; so Hill won't have enough chances to make himself a useful fantasy option.,Injuries,MIL,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-08-24_11AM.pdf
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27117c,2020-07-27T01:57:09,Fred VanVleet Exits Early During Scrimmage,Toronto Raptors guard Fred  Vanvleet (knee) limped to the locker room during the first quarter of Sunday's scrimmage. He suffered a left knee injury while attempting to take a charge. The Raptors have not given much information since then; but they really have no incentive to rush VanVleet back out there. They likely kept him out as a precaution; but more information should be announced soon. Norman  Powell and Terence  Davis would benefit the most if VanVleet is forced to miss time.,Injuries,TOR,TSN.com,https://twitter.com/TSN_Sports/status/1287559209731739649
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271158,2020-10-06T21:37:58,Bam Adebayo Likely To Return In Game 4,Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo (neck) is planning to make his return for Game 4 of the 2020 NBA Finals against the Lakers on Tuesday night; according to sources. Adebayo missed the previous two games of the series due to a neck strain that he suffered in Game 1; forcing the 23-year-old to exit during the second half of the contest. Adebayo's potential return to the lineup will be encouraging news for the Heat; who may be forced to play without guard Goran Dragic (foot) for the remainder of the series as he is without a timetable for a potential return. Adebayo will serve as a solid DFS option for Tuesday's game if he ends up making his return.,Injuries,MIA,Adrian Wojnarowski,https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1313576977358520321?s=20
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27116e,2020-08-29T17:03:49,Gary Harris Questionable For Sunday,Denver Nuggets guard Gary  Harris (hip) is listed as questionable for Sunday's Game 6 against the Utah Jazz. He has not played during the bubble; but has been slowly working his way back. He'll likely be limited if he does get out there for Sunday's contest. Monte  Morris and Torrey  Craig would likely lose some value and usage if Harris returns on Sunday. Fantasy owners should check back for another update closer to tip-off.,Injuries,DEN,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-08-29_11AM.pdf

He was able to drop 25 points through 44 minutes during Thursday's contest despite dealing with a small fracture in his vertebra. McCollum is a little banged up; but he has shown that he can produce through the pain. He could be leaned on a little more than usual with Zach  Collins (ankle) ruled out for this one. Carmelo  Anthony and Hassan  Whiteside could see an uptick in value as well.,Injuries,POR,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-08-17_05PM.pdf

He was a first round pick by the Cavs in 2019; but didn't play in a single game for the team. Windler suffered a leg injury that resulted in surgery; which cost him the entire season. It sounds like he is making progress and getting ready for next year. However; he'll face an uphill battle for minutes after the emergence of Kevin  Porter  Jr. towards the end of the regular season. Windler could find some minutes in Cleveland next season; but probably won't play enough to warrant drafting in most formats.,Injuries,CLE,The Athletic,https://theathletic.com/2077688/
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc27115b,2020-10-01T15:14:24,Kemba Walker Dealt With Lingering Injuries In The Bubble,Boston Celtics guard Kemba  Walker (knee) mentioned that he never felt fully right during his time playing in the bubble. Walker has been dealing with right knee issues since his college days. One of the big concerns was how players are going to adjust after having roughly a four month hiatus from basketball. Walker was never able to get fully healthy; but hopefully he can get the rest he needs during the offseason. The organization does not believe Walker will need to undergo surgery in order to address the issue. Walker could be a fantasy stud once again; assuming he can be fully healthy next season.,Injuries,BOS,Tim Bontemps,https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1311669634115010562
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271165,2020-09-08T00:55:09,Nikola Jokic Will Start Monday,Denver Nuggets center Nikola  Jokic (wrist) will start in Monday's Game 3 matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers. He played well during Game 2; but suffered a right wrist sprain along the way. Jokic was a game-time decision heading into this one; but it appears that he's good to play. It doesn't sound like the Nuggets have any plans to limit him; so DFS players can plug him into their lineups for Monday.,Injuries,DEN,Shams Charania,https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1303120761683611651

He has been given some extra time to prepare and reportedly looked explosive during Thursday's scrimmage. James  Harden and Eric  Gordon will lose some value and usage with Westbrook likely returning.

Over the weekend; the team said that Carter-Williams was day-to-day. It sounds like the team is going to take the cautious approach here and give Carter-Williams plenty of time to rest up. D.J.  Augustin and Terrence  Ross will have increased roles going forward and could be interesting DFS options for Tuesday's slate.,Injuries,ORL,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-08-17_11AM.pdf

He has been trying to get up his conditioning after being quarantined. Williamson mentioned that he wants to be on the court; but who knows if that'll happen this quickly. He would likely be somewhat limited if he does play; so he'd be a risky DFS option.,Sit-Start,NO,Marc J. Spears,https://twitter.com/MarcJSpears/status/1288555003922337793

Neither player is injured; but head coach Terry Stotts wants to make sure both players are healthy for the seeding games. As of right now; it sounds like Whiteside is going to start alongside Jusuf  Nurkic. It'll be interesting to see how they play with each other. Stotts is likely going to mix up his rotation a bit; but none of the centers stand out from the pack. It seems like most of the big men in Portland are going to see around 20 minutes per game.,Sit-Start,POR,Casey Holdahl,https://twitter.com/CHold/status/1288206765595586560

However; he is still not close to getting back on the court after suffering a Grade 3 ankle sprain in mid-August. The hope is that Hayward could return at some point next series; assuming the Celtics advance. Until then; Marcus  Smart and Jaylen  Brown will continue to have increased value.,Injuries,BOS,Marc D'Amico,https://twitter.com/Marc_DAmico/status/1303833665961684994

The 32-year-old guard has not played in the league since the 2018-2019 season with the Toronto Raptors. Lin spent this past season with the Beijing Ducks and put together quite a year. He averaged 22.3 points; 5.7 rebounds; 5.6 assists and most importantly he stayed healthy. It'll be interesting to see if Lin can land another job in the NBA. He'd most likely be a backup guard with minimal playing time. Most likely he wouldn't have much fantasy value; but hopefully he can at least make it back into the league.,Transactions,TOR,Brian Yang,https://twitter.com/briflys/status/1305735194091991041

He was expected to leave the bubble at some point to be with his wife that is expected to give birth soon. His absence shouldn't make much of an impact in the rotation. Robert  Williams has taken away most of his playing time and Daniel  Theis usually starts.,Injuries,BOS,Boston Celtics,https://twitter.com/celtics/status/1301553859366653952

He has not been able to play during the bubble; so this would be his first time seeing game action. He'll most likely have a minutes restriction since he hasn't played in quite some time. Torrey  Craig; Monte  Morris; and possibly Michael  Porter  Jr. will lose some minutes and value with the return of Harris. DFS players can probably avoid Harris on Sunday since he'll be a fairly risky option.,Injuries,DEN,Adrian Wojnarowski,https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1300043117769494532

Winslow is expected to play both guard and forward for Memphis. His versatility is really going to come out in our style of play; Jenkins said. There is a good chance that Winslow spends a majority of his time at small forward. He should get a bulk of the playing time over Kyle  Anderson or Josh  Jackson. He'll be an intriguing DFS option because he can do just about everything on a basketball court.,Risers,MEM,Commercial_Appeal,https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2020/07/11/how-justise-winslows-game-fits-memphis-grizzlies/5381415002/

This appears to be a smart move considering Porter's injury history and he's averaging 33.3 minutes per game during the bubble. Fantasy owners shouldn't expect any of the Nuggets starters to see much playing time in this one. Bol  Bol could end up with significant minutes and could be worth looking at for DFS contests.,Sit-Start,DEN,Kendra Andrews,https://twitter.com/kendra__andrews/status/1294312328385757192

He mentioned that he'll likely have increased ball-handling responsibilities with Rajon  Rondo (thumb) sidelined. Caruso; Dion  Waiters; and J.R.  Smith are all expected to see more minutes without Rondo available. It sounds like Caruso is going to benefit the most; but he won't be a great DFS option. He's averaging 5.4 points over 17.8 minutes per game this season. He'll be a low-cost DFS option for smaller slates.,Risers,LAL,Mike Trudell,https://twitter.com/LakersReporter/status/1283510218425425921

It was unlikely that he was going to suit up anyway after head coach Steve Clifford mentioned Gordon was unable to sprint on Tuesday. Orlando is already down 3-1; so Gordon very well might be out for the rest of the postseason. Gary  Clark is expected to draw another start; but he won't be worth a look in DFS contests.

He is currently listed as day-to-day; so there's a chance that he returns for this one. Markelle  Fultz; D.J.  Augustin; and Terrence  Ross will all gain some fantasy value; assuming Carter-Williams remains out.

He has been sidelined since Game 1; so this is a big lift for Miami. It's unclear whether or not Adebayo will be limited; which makes him a risky DFS option.

He is still dealing with a foot issue that he suffered during the first game of the series. Kendrick  Nunn is expected to join the starting five; while Tyler  Herro gets more minutes as well.

He was able to play during their first game of the series; but was only out there for 12 minutes. The Clippers are likely going to push him a little more during his second game back; but won't see his normal workload. Which means; Beverley won't be worth targeting in DFS contests for Saturday's slate.

Both superstars have been listed as probable multiple times during the postseason and they continue to play. It doesn't sound like either player is going to be sidelined here. Fantasy owners should check back before tip-off; but both Davis and James should be reliable DFS options for Sunday's slate.,Injuries,LAL,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-09-05_05PM.pdf

He has been sidelined since after Game 1 against the Dallas Mavericks during the first round. He'll likely be eased back into action since he hasn't played in quite a bit. His return should mean less minutes for Reggie  Jackson and Landry  Shamet. Neither of them are appealing DFS options for Thursday's slate.,Injuries,LAC,Ohm Youngmisuk,https://twitter.com/NotoriousOHM/status/1301661114338430976
5f7d90dc5eb54e41bc271175,2020-08-21T15:32:21,Rondae Hollis-Jefferson Questionable For Game 3,Toronto Raptors forward Rondae  Hollis-Jefferson (knee) is listed as questionable for Thursday's Game 3 against the Brooklyn Nets. He is dealing with swelling in his left knee; but it's unclear if he'll be able to play through it. Hollis-Jefferson is averaging nine minutes per game in this series; so his absence won't make a significant impact in the rotation. The Raptors big men could see a few extra minutes; but it won't change much for fantasy purposes.,Injuries,TOR,NBA Injury Report,https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2020-08-21_11AM.pdf
