	<h6>Data</h6>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/nba">SportsRadar API</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api">API-NBA</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/basketball/WNBA_v3#wnba-api-map">Sportradar: WNBA API</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We are obtaining the data from existing NBA/WNBA and news APIs and using MongoDB as our database. The data is being requested through our main.py. The user may search up a certain player or team and our code requests the information about that searched element from these API’s and then displays the information to the user. For the user’s favorite players and teams information, they will be stored in MongoDB so that it is saved on their Favorite Player and Favorite Team pages for their specific account that they log in with on our website.  
	</p>

	<h6>Tools</h6>
	<p>
	API-NBA: We are using the API-NBA to grab information about NBA players and teams.</p>
	<p>WNBA-API: We are using the WNBA API provided by sportradar to grab information about WNBA players and teams.</p>
	<p>ESPN API: We are using the ESPN API to grab news about the NBA and WNBA, as well as other statistics and season/trade predictions.</p>
	<p>MongoDB: We are using MongoDB to store all the information we have gathered from our APIs, so we can easily access them via our program and the web.</p>
	<p>Google Cloud Platform: We are using GCP to host our website, so anyone can have access to it and be able to use the website.</p>
	<p>Flask: We are using Flask to have our python code work alongside the code for our static website.</p>
	<p>Bootstrap: We are using Bootstrap CSS to add more stylization to our website, and make it visually appealing to the user.
