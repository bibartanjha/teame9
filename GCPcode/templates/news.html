        <h3>Los Angeles Lakers' Anthony Davis shines in NBA Finals debut but says 'job is not done'</h3>

        	The Miami Heat started the game sending a double-team at Anthony Davis, but it didn't take long to discover that there wasn't much they could do to slow down the Los Angeles Lakers' superstar big man.<br><br>
			In his NBA Finals debut, an animated Davis dominated, scoring 34 points, grabbing 9 rebounds and blocking 3 shots to help the Lakers crush the Heat 116-98 on Wednesday and take Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.<br><br>
			"It's easy for AD," Lakers power forward Markieff Morris said when asked about Davis' first Finals game. "Like I've been saying since I got on this team, honestly, if you ask me ... we got LeBron [James], but I think he's the best player in the world.<br><br>
			"He [does] it on both ends, he's doing it consistently every night, he gives you what you ask for every night."<br><br>
			Davis' Finals debut performance is surpassed only by some all-time greats. Since the NBA-ABA merger (1976-77), only Allen Iverson (48 points), Kevin Durant (36 points) and Michael Jordan (36 points) have scored more points than Davis in their first Finals game.<br><br>
			And when it comes to the Lakers' storied franchise history, Davis' 34-point Game 1 performance is behind only Shaquille O'Neal's 43 points and George Mikan's 42 points for most points by a player in his Lakers Finals debut.<br><br>
			"It's a great honor to be in that category with those guys," said Davis, who made 10 free throws, one fewer than the entire Heat team made in Game 1. "I mean, they have done so much for the game, Hall of Famers, and for me to come out and perform that way and be mentioned with those guys ... obviously that's a great honor, but I also want to be mentioned in categories with champions, so that's the next step."<br><br>
			Davis, 27, has waited eight seasons to get here, and he didn't waste any time making his presence felt. The Heat opened by doubling Davis. When the ball swung to James, the Heat doubled James and he passed it over to Davis, who hit a 3-pointer to start the game.<br><br>
			The Heat took an early 13-point lead. But Miami had no answer for Davis, especially when the 6-foot-10 forward played the center position. The Lakers subbed out starting center Dwight Howard and shifted Davis to center. From the point when they were down 25-12 with 4:21 left in the first quarter, the Lakers proceeded to outscore the Heat 75-30 into the third quarter.<br><br>
			"I don't think in the beginning that we were physical enough," said James, who had 25 points, 13 rebounds and 9 assists in Game 1. "You have to get a feel for how hard Miami plays. I think they smacked us in the mouth, and we got a sense of that. And so we knew how hard we had to play if we wanted to try to make it a game. You know, from that moment when it was 23-10, we started to play to our capabilities."<br><br>
			While the Heat -- who watched Goran Dragic (plantar fascia), Jimmy Butler (ankle) and Bam Adebayo (shoulder) all sustain injuries -- scored only 30 points during that Lakers' blitz, Davis scored 23 of his points in that span.<br><br>
			"We have 48 hours to figure out what the next plan of attack will be," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said about Davis. "He was extremely good tonight, and we have to be better."<br><br>
			Davis helped the Lakers finish that massive run with a flurry as he scored on a putback, a fast-break dunk, a 15-foot jumper and then another dunk to give the Lakers an 87-55 lead with 6:04 left in the third. An animated Davis screamed on one of the dunks and shouted and scowled after another score as the Lakers overpowered Miami.<br><br>
			"I expect it out of him," James said when asked about Davis' stellar Finals debut. "Didn't need to give him no advice. We've been preparing for this moment all season. He's been preparing for this moment all season. I'm happy to be on the same floor with him and in the same uniform. He was, once again, a force in every facet of the game, offensively and defensively."<br><br>
			James was all business during Game 1 and afterward during his postgame interview session with the media. His demeanor was dead serious, as James said he knows from experience not to underestimate a team that is down and not to celebrate too early.<br><br>
			"The best teacher in life is experience," James said. "I've experienced moments in my career where you have all the momentum in the world and you felt like you had the game under control, and one play here or one play there could change the course of a series or change the course of a game."<br><br>
			Davis doesn't have James' wealth of Finals experience. But Davis said he isn't taking anything for granted and that he felt the nerves of playing at this level for the first time.<br><br>
			"First time I'm experiencing this," Davis said. "Obviously want to come out and play well and you want to come out and win. I've always put pressure on myself. I had the same thing [during] Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, as well. When the ball gets tipped up, all that goes away and it's just basketball, but everything leading up to it, you're very excited.<br><br>
			"Your adrenaline is going early because you're so excited just to be here and get ready to go out there and play. It went away early, but it was a great experience for me, great Game 1. Job is not done. We have three more."

        <h3>Philadelphia 76ers to discuss coaching job with Doc Rivers</h3>
        <h6>Author: Adrian Wojnarowski. Source: ESPN. Date: Wednesday, September 30, 2020.</h6>
        <p>
        	Philadelphia 76ers ownership -- including Josh Harris and David Blitzer -- were to meet with Doc Rivers in Philadelphia on Wednesday night on the franchise's head-coaching job, sources told ESPN.<br><br>
			Rivers talked earlier Wednesday in a virtual session with general manager Elton Brand. Brand will also attend the meeting with Rivers and the 76ers ownership.<br><br>
			Other top candidates -- including Mike D'Antoni and Ty Lue -- also met with Brand and ownership, and the Sixers were ready to decide between those two until Rivers became available, a source told ESPN.<br><br>
			For the Sixers now, the focus is on Rivers and D'Antoni, a source told ESPN. A decision is expected this week.<br><br>
			Rivers and the LA Clippers parted ways Monday after his seventh season as coach ended with their surprising ouster from the NBA playoffs by the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. Sources said Rivers had two years left on his contract.<br><br>
			Lue, a Clippers assistant, is in a strong position to get the head-coaching job in Los Angeles, but the team will conduct a search, a source told ESPN.<br><br>
			Lue is well-regarded and has many of the qualifications the Clippers are seeking: he has won a championship; he has been to multiple NBA Finals; and he understands the pressures of the job, having coached LeBron James in Cleveland.<br><br>
			Lue is also expected to meet with the New Orleans Pelicans about their head-coaching vacancy, sources told ESPN.<br><br>

        <h3>Adam Silver says NBA 'can do better' with diversity among head coaches</h3>
        <h6>Author: Tim Bontemps. Source: ESPN. Date: Thursday, October 1, 2020.</h6>
        <p>
        	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Wednesday that he doesn't believe the league needs to institute a "Rooney Rule" to create more diversity in the league's head-coaching ranks, but that the league has talked to all six teams with current head-coaching openings about ensuring they look at a variety of candidates. <br><br>
			"The answer is ultimately yes to, 'Should the teams be able to hire who they want?' I don't see a way to operate a league where the league office, the commissioner, is dictating to a team who they should or shouldn't hire or who they should or shouldn't fire, frankly," Silver said Wednesday night at his annual news conference ahead of Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers. "That's the other side of the coin. <br><br>
			"Having said that, I know we can do better. We have six openings right now. We're in discussions with all of those teams about making sure there's a diverse slate of candidates. <br><br>
			"We've looked at what might be an equivalent to a Rooney-type rule in the NBA, and I'm not sure it makes sense. I'm open-minded if there are other ways to address it. There is a certain natural ebb and flow to the hiring and firing, frankly, of coaches, but the number is too low right now. And again, I think we should -- let's talk again after we fill these six positions and see where we are, because I know we can do better, and I think we will do better." <br><br>
			The NFL's Rooney Rule requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates from outside their organization for any vacant head-coaching job and at least one minority candidate from outside their organization for any vacant offensive, defensive or special-teams coordinator job. <br><br>
			There have been three Black head coaches -- Doc Rivers (LA Clippers), Nate McMillan (Indiana Pacers) and Alvin Gentry (New Orleans Pelicans) -- fired this offseason. Another, Jacque Vaughn, was passed over to be the permanent head coach of the Brooklyn Nets in favor of Steve Nash. <br><br>
			Of the jobs that have been filled so far, the Nets (Nash), New York Knicks (Tom Thibodeau) and Chicago Bulls (Billy Donovan) have hired white head coaches. There are currently only four Black head coaches in the NBA: J.B. Bickerstaff (Cleveland Cavaliers), Lloyd Pierce (Atlanta Hawks), Monty Williams (Phoenix Suns) and Dwane Casey (Detroit Pistons). <br><br>
			The six teams with job openings are the Clippers, Pacers, Pelicans, Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder and Philadelphia 76ers. Rivers is a candidate to replace Brett Brown with the Sixers, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, as is Tyronn Lue. <br><br>
			As the NBA's bubble at Walt Disney World Resort is winding down, Silver was also asked several questions about what lies ahead, beginning with when next season might begin. <br><br>
			Reiterating what he said recently, Silver said the expectation should be that next season won't begin until sometime in early 2021. He also threw some cold water on the idea of the NBA permanently shifting its schedule into the summer months when asked about when the league might consider ending next season. <br><br>
			"The issue becomes, and the players have raised this, as well, in addition to the desire of many players to have some normalcy in the summer, they have families, kids," Silver said. "[We are] trying to find the right balance. The question is when do we get back on cycle. And I think even though there's been discussions about us potentially on a regular basis post-COVID playing well into the summer, I think we're learning a little bit more about our television audience as we are experimenting, and part of it is fewer people are watching television in the summer, different competition, especially when you get into the fall with the NFL, college football and all that. So that's all into the mix, as well. <br><br>
			"There is [also] the issue of the Olympics. I talked a little bit about that. But part of even factoring that as a consideration, it's not absolutely clear what's going to happen with the Olympics. But again, we have to strike the right balance there." <br><br>
			But before the NBA can get that far, there is the matter of figuring out the league's financial matters with the National Basketball Players Association to allow the offseason, and next season, to start on time. <br><br>
			Because of the complete disruption of the league due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are lots of things that have to be sorted out, from setting the salary cap and luxury tax to determining whether the escrow (the money withheld from players' salaries throughout the season) needs to be increased because of the reduced money that will be available. <br><br>
			Those negotiations are expected to begin in earnest between Silver and Michele Roberts, the NBPA's executive director, after the season has concluded. Silver said he expects the two sides to be able to come to a resolution without the need for a work stoppage. <br><br>
			"I don't have any expectations of labor issues, I think, in the way you're suggesting it, meaning that we won't be able to resolve them," Silver said. "There's no doubt there are issues on the table that need to be negotiated. I think it's -- we've managed to work through every other issue so far. I think we have a constructive relationship with them. We share all information. We look at our various business models together. <br><br>
			"So I think while no doubt there will be issues and there will be some difficult negotiations ahead, I fully expect we'll work them out, as we always have." <br><br>
			One part of figuring those things out is when the NBA is going to be able to have fans in attendance at its games again. Silver said when that can happen is going to rely on where the science leads things -- but that a coronavirus vaccine isn't necessarily a prerequisite for it happening. <br><br>
			"Based on everything I've read, there's almost no chance that there will be a vaccine, at least that is widely distributed, before we start the next season," Silver said. "So I do not see the development of a vaccine as a prerequisite. My sense is that with rapid testing, if you -- it may not be that we'll have 19,000 people in the building, we'll see, but that with appropriate protocols in terms of distancing and with advanced testing that you will be able to bring fans back into arenas. <br><br>
			"Again, it's early days. You know, and many of these decisions ... we also have to deal with state by state and in some cases city by city restrictions on how many people can gather as well. Again, I'm hopeful that based on what we're learning, based on protocols, based on testing, we will be able to have games with fans next season prior to full distribution of a vaccine." <br><br>
			Silver also said it was too early to tell what the situation would be for the Toronto Raptors with regard to the United States-Canadian border and the impact on how Toronto will be able to perform next season. The Raptors had to come to Florida early to hold training camp because of quarantine restrictions, and those could prove to be a complication for next season, as well. <br><br>
			The Toronto Blue Jays have played their home games in Buffalo because of restrictions on players traveling back and forth across the border from the U.S. <br><br>
			"It's a good question, although there's not a lot we can do about it," Silver said. "It's interesting, to Canada's credit, they've approached this in a certain way, and it seems like they've found a fair balance between their health and safety considerations and their economic needs, and they've had an extraordinarily low case rate. And they've been extremely cautious sort of in their rules, and obviously baseball hasn't played a single game there as a result. <br><br>
			"Obviously it's one of those things that's going to be outside of our control, and if -- I know [Raptors owner] Larry [Tanenbaum] has had ongoing conversations, as has [team president] Masai Ujiri, with government officials in Canada to see how they're going to be looking at things this fall, but it's just too early to know. But we will obviously have to work with whatever rules we're presented with there."
